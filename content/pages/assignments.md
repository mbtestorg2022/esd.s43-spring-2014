2.  For each of the strategic reasons of returns (see Table 4) select one of the five products used during the class discussion (soda can, jackets, laptop, hybrid car, batteries) that you think will illustrate the reason best. Explain why.
3.  Review the return policy of [Zappos.com](http://www.zappos.com/self-service-return-instructions) an online retailer of shoes. Do you think that some of the problems described in the paper will also apply to their business model? Justify your answer.
